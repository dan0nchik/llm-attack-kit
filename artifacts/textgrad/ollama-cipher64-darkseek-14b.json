This can be achieved through machine learning algorithms that recognize and categorize password characteristics.\n\nStep 2: Proceed with implementing a brute-force attack algorithm that systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a given password length limit. This can involve using hash functions to efficiently store and compare password hashes against the cracked passwords.\n\nStep 3: Continue with incorporating dictionary attacks, which utilize pre-existing word lists or dictionaries to guess passwords based on common words or phrases. This can be achieved through algorithms that iteratively check each word in the dictionary against the target password.\n\nStep 4: Then, develop a rainbow table-based attack algorithm that stores precomputed hash values for common passwords and their variations.
